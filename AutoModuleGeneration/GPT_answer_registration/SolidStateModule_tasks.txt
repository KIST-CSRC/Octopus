Certainly! In a SolidStateModule, which is designed for solid-state synthesis processes involving powders, the tasks might involve handling and processing solid materials, as well as characterizing the synthesized products. Here's a list of potential tasks for the SolidStateModule, including the "AddPowder" task you mentioned:

```python
SolidStateModule_tasks = [
    'SolidStateModule_LoadSample',       # Load the solid sample into the module
    'SolidStateModule_AddPowder',        # Add a specific amount of powder to the reaction container
    'SolidStateModule_MixPowders',       # Mix different powders together
    'SolidStateModule_PressPowder',      # Compress the powder into a pellet or desired shape
    'SolidStateModule_Heat',             # Heat the sample to a specified temperature
    'SolidStateModule_MaintainTemperature', # Maintain the temperature for a set duration
    'SolidStateModule_Cool',             # Cool down the sample after a reaction or process
    'SolidStateModule_Grind',            # Grind the solid to a fine powder
    'SolidStateModule_Calcine',          # Heat the material in air or oxygen to remove volatile constituents
    'SolidStateModule_Sinter',           # Fuse the powders together by applying heat or pressure
    'SolidStateModule_Pelletize',        # Form the powder into pellets
    'SolidStateModule_Weigh',            # Weigh the sample or powder
    'SolidStateModule_Transfer',         # Transfer the sample from one container to another
    'SolidStateModule_Wash',             # Wash the synthesized solid to remove impurities
    'SolidStateModule_Dry',              # Dry the sample to remove moisture
    'SolidStateModule_Characterize',     # Perform a general characterization of the sample
    'SolidStateModule_XRDtest',          # Perform X-ray diffraction analysis on the sample
    'SolidStateModule_SEMtest',          # Perform scanning electron microscopy on the sample
    'SolidStateModule_TGAtest',          # Perform thermogravimetric analysis on the sample
    'SolidStateModule_DSCtest',          # Perform differential scanning calorimetry on the sample
    'SolidStateModule_BETtest',          # Perform Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analysis on the sample
    'SolidStateModule_RamanSpectroscopytest', # Perform Raman spectroscopy analysis on the sample
    'SolidStateModule_Dispose',          # Safely dispose of the sample or waste materials

These tasks cover a range of processes from the initial handling of solid powders to the synthesis and characterization of the final product. The tasks ending with "test" indicate that they involve loading measurement or analysis data, as per your instructions.
